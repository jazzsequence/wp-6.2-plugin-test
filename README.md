# WordPress 6.2 Tester plugin

Tests some new features of WP 6.2.

## Currently testing

### `move_dir`

An admin page is created with buttons that attempt to use the new `move_dir` command. The assumption is that you are working on an immutable filesystem, so some instances of `move_dir` will be impossible due to file write permissions. The actions will fire regardless and work successfully on systems with full read/write access (e.g. localdev) but the descriptions indicate the expected behavior.

## Uses

* [CMB2/CMB2](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2) - For an easy-to-bootstrap admin page. Creates a custom field type for the buttons.

This file is not recommended for any kind of production use. There are no nonces and we're moving stuff around the filesystem. Use at your own peril. ðŸ˜…
